# How JavaScript Changed the Web Development Landscape

## Introduction

In the early days of the internet, websites were simple, static, and not very interactive. Fast forward to today, and we see modern websites that are fast, interactive, and dynamic. One major technology behind this shift is **JavaScript**. In this post, we will explore how JavaScript revolutionized the web development landscape and its ongoing impact.

## The Early Days of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape. Initially, it was seen as a simple tool to make webpages more interactive. However, it quickly evolved and became one of the most important programming languages in the world. Today, it is used for everything from front-end development to back-end services.

### Key Features of JavaScript

Here are a few key features that make JavaScript stand out:

- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which makes it flexible for developers to work with.
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: Unlike other languages, JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance system, which allows for dynamic property addition to objects.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: With the introduction of Promises and `async/await`, JavaScript allows developers to write non-blocking code, improving performance in web apps.

```javascript
// Example of asynchronous code
async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}
fetchData();
